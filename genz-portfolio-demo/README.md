## 🎮 Customization Guide

### **Change Colors**
Edit `tailwind.config.js` and `src/styles/globals.css`:
```css
:root {
  --neon-pink: #your-color;
  --neon-blue: #your-color;
  /* Add your custom colors */
}
```

### **Update Project Data**
Modify `src/data/projects.ts`:
```typescript
export const projects: Project[] = [
  {
    id: 'your-project',
    title: 'Your Awesome Project',
    description: 'Your project description with emojis! 🚀',
    emoji: '🔥',
    // ... more project data
  }
];
```

### **Customize 3D Elements**
Edit `src/components/3d/FloatingGeometry.tsx`:
- Add new 3D shapes (Sphere, Box, Octahedron, Torus)
- Modify colors and materials
- Adjust animation speeds and patterns

### **Add Sound Effects**
```typescript
// Install Howler.js (already included)
import { Howl } from 'howler';

const sound = new Howl({
  src: ['/path/to/your/sound.mp3'],
  volume: 0.5,
});

// Play on interaction
sound.play();
```
